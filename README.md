# Awesome Messenger Comparisons

Trying to figure out which messaging app meets your security requirements?

## NSA

One of the stated missions of the NSA is to protect the communications of U.S. networks and information systems. Namely, they're interested in protecting the information of U.S. corporations -- to protect the U.S. economy.

While, historically, the NSA has [spearheaded illegal projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s_global_surveillance_disclosures) that harmed the communications of everyday U.S. citizens, the NSA has a history of publishing [extremely useful guidance](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/nsa-releases-security-guidance-for-red-hat-enterprise-linux-5) on how to secure technical infrastructure -- written for the U.S. corporations.

The NSA has also published [a guide](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/14/2002477670/-1/-1/0/) that compares the security features of various messaging apps
